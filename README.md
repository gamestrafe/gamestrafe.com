# GameStrafe.com

This is the overview portal site for the GameStrafe network.

Contributions are always welcome!

## Simple contributions

Clone the project locally:
`git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:gamestrafe/gamestrafe.com.git`

Edit the MD files in _sources and that's it. This project uses [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) as a generator if you want to look up some more on that. If you add a page you also have to add a link to it in the place you think works best. All pages are automatically added to the sitemap.

Once you are done with your changes, open a merge request against the repo. Please have some good description on the commits and if you have to test around, squash the commits first.

## Advanced contributions

Same as above, clone it recursively, then either start hacking away or use [Drifter](https://github.com/liip/drifter) with `vagrant up` to have a complete box with all needed bit setup for you.

Other than that same above, make an MR.
